-testing of project itself

-take a list of files as a command line, not just single/folder

add total failed

check mode for sanity
waitForElementToNotBeDisplayed

screenshot mode, one take all screenshots (like now)
another mode is take screenshots for failed steps only

create two json variants, one with base64 screenshots if they are there.
if they are there, also create another report with images


server:
  create client (create a folder with client reference the same in database)
  create website (entity under client, with folder as well)
  daily deamon that goes over all the clients and runs the tests and pushes stuff
  email results and cc/bcc an account for us.
  upload files to the folder and list them as the tests
  after test is run, push results into database
  reports will take the results and work with it
  client access? perhaps with guid is the easiest, instead of username/password.
